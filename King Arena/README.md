===========

This is the source code for a server that used to be up that I was head admin and dev on, but is sadly gone.

btw yes this is essentially nostalgia for me. this is my real first plugin I've ever really made for someone other than myself.

and yes - this was made when I used Eclipse for coding, so pardon all the derpy formatting >.> plus I had to completely decompile this by hand into .java files, so just ignore "var[x]" variables - sorry!

also; feel free to download the plugins, idec about what you use them for, for a public server, private, idc - just don't claim them as your own or add a paywall like adfly to download them
