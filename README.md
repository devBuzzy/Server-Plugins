***READ ME FOR FLUFFS SAKES***

These plugins are my works, and are from servers that removed the plugin due to "buggyness" (*cough* ZeroCraft *cough*) or just generally died.

I have removed King Arena's jars, thus you have to compile them on your own. ZeroCraft has never had jars in it's repository, so it's generally not even a bother for me to remove them.

If you wish to compile the plugins, I personally recommend IntelliJ Idea for better compiling. Eclipse works too, though it's buggy with the special characters that ZeroCraft has in it's plugin files from what I know of.
