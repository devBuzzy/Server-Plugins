ZeroCraft's Plugin
====

FAQ
----

1. You stole the plugin! Theif!
A: No, I did not. I made the plugin. You can even ask CommonSense_64. The source code in here is entirely my code I have made for the ZeroCraft server. Basically, for me, this is a "**** you, Zero".

2. Why did you do this?
A: http://puu.sh/cyoIU.png - key in point these lines.

```
If you are wondering about your opportunities to become moderator in stream or on server again, that time has come and gone.
```

```
2. If it wasn't about being a mod you would not have left for a month.

Kappa 
```

Yet I have stated many times "I do not want/care about moderator on the server or stream."

3. What happened to make you leave ZeroCraft?
A: Both a giant mistake I made, and Zero claiming the points stated above.

4. What was that mistake?
A: I'd rather not talk about it.

5. Can I use this for my server?
A: Yes, I don't care, but you'll probably have to change a lot of things to make it for your server alone. This is the final source code edition, and thus I don't care about it anymore.
